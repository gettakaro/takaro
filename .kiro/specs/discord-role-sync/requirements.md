# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements bidirectional role synchronization between Discord and Takaro, ensuring that role assignments remain consistent across both platforms. The system will react to role changes in real-time through event listeners and provide a scheduled sync mechanism as a fallback for missed events. Users can configure which platform serves as the source of truth for role management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a server administrator, I want roles to automatically sync between Discord and Takaro when assigned or removed, so that users have consistent permissions across both platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a role is assigned to a user in Discord THEN the system SHALL assign the corresponding role in Takaro within 30 seconds
2. WHEN a role is removed from a user in Discord THEN the system SHALL remove the corresponding role in Takaro within 30 seconds
3. WHEN a role is assigned to a user in Takaro THEN the system SHALL assign the corresponding role in Discord within 30 seconds
4. WHEN a role is removed from a user in Takaro THEN the system SHALL remove the corresponding role in Discord within 30 seconds
5. IF role mapping does not exist between platforms THEN the system SHALL log the event and continue without error

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a server administrator, I want the system to listen for role change events in real-time, so that synchronization happens immediately when changes occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Discord role events are received THEN the system SHALL process them within 5 seconds
2. WHEN Takaro role events are received THEN the system SHALL process them within 5 seconds
3. IF an event processing fails THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
4. WHEN event processing fails after all retries THEN the system SHALL log the failure and queue for scheduled sync
5. IF the event listener connection is lost THEN the system SHALL automatically reconnect within 60 seconds

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a server administrator, I want a scheduled sync process that runs periodically, so that any missed events or inconsistencies are automatically corrected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the scheduled sync runs THEN the system SHALL compare all user roles between Discord and Takaro
2. IF role inconsistencies are found THEN the system SHALL resolve them based on the configured source of truth
3. WHEN scheduled sync completes THEN the system SHALL log a summary of changes made
4. IF scheduled sync encounters errors THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and continue processing other users
5. WHEN scheduled sync is configured THEN it SHALL run at intervals between 5 minutes and 24 hours

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a server administrator, I want to configure which platform is the source of truth for role management, so that I can control the direction of synchronization when conflicts occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN source of truth is set to Discord THEN Discord roles SHALL take precedence during conflict resolution
2. WHEN source of truth is set to Takaro THEN Takaro roles SHALL take precedence during conflict resolution
3. WHEN source of truth setting is changed THEN the system SHALL apply the new setting to subsequent sync operations
4. IF no source of truth is configured THEN the system SHALL default to Takaro as the source of truth
5. WHEN bidirectional sync is enabled THEN both platforms SHALL be kept in sync regardless of source of truth

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a server administrator, I want to configure linked Discord roles within Takaro roles, so that the system knows which roles correspond between platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring a Takaro role THEN the system SHALL allow setting a 'linked Discord role' field
2. WHEN a Takaro role has a linked Discord role configured THEN the system SHALL synchronize changes between these specific roles
3. IF a Takaro role has no linked Discord role THEN the system SHALL skip synchronization for that role
4. IF a Discord role is not linked to any Takaro role THEN the system SHALL skip synchronization for that role
5. WHEN linked Discord role configuration is updated THEN the system SHALL apply changes to future sync operations
6. WHEN linked Discord role configuration is removed THEN the system SHALL stop synchronizing that specific role pair

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a server administrator, I want to enable or disable role synchronization, so that I can control when the feature is active.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN role sync is enabled THEN the system SHALL start event listeners and scheduled sync
2. WHEN role sync is disabled THEN the system SHALL stop all synchronization activities
3. IF role sync is disabled during operation THEN the system SHALL gracefully stop current sync processes
4. WHEN role sync setting is changed THEN the system SHALL apply the change within 30 seconds
5. IF role sync is disabled THEN the system SHALL not process any role change events

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a server administrator, I want to view sync logs and statistics, so that I can monitor the health and performance of role synchronization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN role sync operations occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information about each sync action
2. WHEN sync errors occur THEN the system SHALL log error details including user, role, and failure reason
3. WHEN sync statistics are requested THEN the system SHALL provide counts of successful and failed operations
4. IF sync performance degrades THEN the system SHALL log performance metrics and warnings
5. WHEN sync logs are queried THEN the system SHALL support filtering by date, user, role, and operation type
