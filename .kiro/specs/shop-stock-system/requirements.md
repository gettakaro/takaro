# Shop Stock System Requirements

## Introduction

The Shop Stock System introduces optional inventory management capabilities to the existing shop functionality. This feature allows shop administrators to enable stock tracking and set stock quantities for shop listings, preventing users from purchasing items that are out of stock. Listings without stock management enabled will continue to have unlimited availability, ensuring backwards compatibility.

## User Stories

### US-1: Shop Admin Stock Management
**As a** shop administrator  
**I want** to optionally enable stock management and set stock quantities for each shop listing  
**So that** I can control item availability and prevent overselling when needed

### US-2: Stock Visibility
**As a** shop administrator  
**I want** to see current stock levels for all listings with stock management enabled  
**So that** I can monitor inventory and make restocking decisions

### US-3: Purchase Prevention
**As a** user  
**I want** to be prevented from purchasing out-of-stock items  
**So that** I don't attempt to buy unavailable products

### US-4: Stock Display
**As a** user  
**I want** to see stock availability when browsing shop listings  
**So that** I know whether items are available before attempting to purchase

### US-5: Bulk Stock Management
**As a** shop administrator  
**I want** to update stock levels for multiple listings at once  
**So that** I can efficiently manage inventory across my shop

## Acceptance Criteria

### Stock Configuration
- **REQ-001**: The system SHALL provide a boolean field 'stockManagementEnabled' for each shop listing to control whether stock management is active
- **REQ-002**: WHEN stockManagementEnabled is true, the system SHALL accept stock values of 0 or any positive integer
- **REQ-003**: WHEN stockManagementEnabled is false, the system SHALL treat the listing as having unlimited stock
- **REQ-004**: WHEN a listing is created, the system SHALL default stockManagementEnabled to false for backwards compatibility
- **REQ-005**: The system SHALL allow shop administrators to toggle stockManagementEnabled at any time
- **REQ-006**: The system SHALL allow shop administrators to update stock quantities at any time for listings with stock management enabled

### Stock Enforcement
- **REQ-007**: WHEN stock management is enabled AND stock reaches 0, the system SHALL prevent users from purchasing that listing
- **REQ-008**: IF a user attempts to purchase an out-of-stock item, THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
- **REQ-009**: The system SHALL automatically decrement stock when an order is created (payment successful)
- **REQ-010**: IF multiple users attempt to purchase the same item concurrently, the system SHALL ensure stock is not oversold through atomic operations
- **REQ-011**: The system SHALL validate that requested purchase quantity does not exceed available stock

### Stock Restoration
- **REQ-012**: WHEN an order is canceled, the system SHALL restore the stock quantity
- **REQ-013**: IF order delivery fails but payment succeeded, the system SHALL maintain the stock decrement (order remains completed)
- **REQ-014**: WHEN a listing is deleted or set to draft with pending orders, the system SHALL handle stock appropriately

### Stock Display
- **REQ-015**: The system SHALL display current stock levels to shop administrators in the shop management interface
- **REQ-016**: The system SHALL indicate stock status to users (in-stock, low-stock, out-of-stock) in the shop listing view
- **REQ-017**: The system SHALL include stockManagementEnabled and stock quantity in API responses for listings

### Bulk Operations
- **REQ-018**: The system SHALL support bulk updates for stock quantities across multiple listings
- **REQ-019**: The system SHALL include stock information when importing/exporting shop configurations
- **REQ-020**: The system SHALL preserve stock values during import unless explicitly overridden

### Event System Integration
- **REQ-021**: The system SHALL emit an event when stock reaches zero
- **REQ-022**: The system SHALL emit an event when stock is updated
- **REQ-023**: The system SHALL emit an event when a purchase is prevented due to insufficient stock

### Data Persistence and Migration
- **REQ-024**: The system SHALL persist stock quantities and stockManagementEnabled flag in the database
- **REQ-025**: The system SHALL provide a migration that adds stock fields to existing listings with stockManagementEnabled defaulting to false
- **REQ-026**: All existing listings SHALL continue to function as unlimited stock after migration

## Clarifications (Based on Requirements Analysis)

1. **Stock Behavior**: Stock management is optional per listing via the `stockManagementEnabled` boolean field
2. **Multiple Purchases**: Users can purchase multiple quantities (via the existing `amount` field in orders) - stock validation will check total requested amount
3. **Stock Alerts**: Deferred to future enhancement - events will enable this functionality
4. **Reserved Stock**: Not needed - atomic operations during order creation will prevent race conditions
5. **Stock History**: Covered by the existing event system - stock changes will emit events
6. **Permissions**: Uses existing shop management permissions (MANAGE_SHOP)
7. **API Changes**: Stock information will be included in existing shop listing endpoints
8. **Import/Export**: Yes, stock values and settings will be included in import/export

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- **NFR-001**: Stock checks SHALL not significantly impact shop browsing performance
- **NFR-002**: Stock updates SHALL be processed within 1 second
- **NFR-003**: Concurrent order creation SHALL be handled efficiently without blocking

### Scalability  
- **NFR-004**: The system SHALL handle concurrent stock updates without data loss through database transactions
- **NFR-005**: The system SHALL support shops with up to 10,000 listings with stock tracking
- **NFR-006**: Stock queries SHALL be optimized with appropriate database indexes

### Security
- **NFR-007**: Only authorized shop administrators SHALL be able to modify stock quantities
- **NFR-008**: Stock modification actions SHALL be logged via the event system
- **NFR-009**: Stock values SHALL be validated to prevent negative or invalid values

### Reliability
- **NFR-010**: Stock decrements SHALL be atomic to prevent overselling
- **NFR-011**: Failed transactions SHALL properly rollback stock changes
- **NFR-012**: The system SHALL handle edge cases gracefully (e.g., concurrent updates, system failures)
