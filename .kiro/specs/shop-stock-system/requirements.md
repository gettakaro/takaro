# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a comprehensive stock management system to the existing shop functionality. The system will track inventory levels for each shop listing, prevent overselling through race condition protection, and provide administrative controls for stock management. The stock system must be resilient to high-throughput scenarios where multiple users attempt to purchase limited stock simultaneously.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see the available stock for shop listings, so that I know how many items are available for purchase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing shop listings THEN the system SHALL display the current stock quantity for each listing
2. WHEN stock is zero THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate that the item is out of stock
3. WHEN stock is low (configurable threshold) THEN the system SHALL display a low stock warning
4. IF a listing has unlimited stock THEN the system SHALL display "Unlimited" or similar indicator

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to be prevented from purchasing items that are out of stock, so that I don't waste time attempting invalid purchases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN stock is zero THEN the system SHALL disable the purchase button/option
2. WHEN attempting to purchase more items than available stock THEN the system SHALL reject the order with an appropriate error message
3. WHEN stock becomes zero during my purchase attempt THEN the system SHALL prevent the purchase and notify me
4. IF multiple users attempt to purchase the last item simultaneously THEN only one SHALL succeed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to set and manage stock levels for shop listings, so that I can control inventory availability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a shop listing THEN the system SHALL allow setting an initial stock quantity
2. WHEN updating a shop listing THEN the system SHALL allow modifying the stock quantity
3. WHEN setting stock to unlimited THEN the system SHALL accept a special value (e.g., -1 or null) to indicate unlimited stock
4. WHEN reducing stock below current pending orders THEN the system SHALL warn the administrator
5. IF stock is set to zero THEN the system SHALL automatically mark the listing as unavailable for purchase

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to refill stock for existing listings, so that I can replenish inventory without recreating listings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing stock management THEN the system SHALL provide a dedicated interface for stock operations
2. WHEN refilling stock THEN the system SHALL allow adding to the current stock quantity
3. WHEN refilling stock THEN the system SHALL allow setting an absolute stock quantity
4. WHEN stock is refilled THEN the system SHALL log the action with timestamp and administrator details
5. IF a listing was previously out of stock THEN refilling SHALL automatically make it available for purchase again

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want cancelled orders to restore stock levels, so that inventory is accurately maintained when purchases are reversed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an order is cancelled THEN the system SHALL restore the purchased quantity back to the listing's stock
2. WHEN an order cancellation fails THEN the system SHALL not restore stock and SHALL log the error
3. WHEN stock is restored THEN the system SHALL ensure the stock doesn't exceed any maximum limits
4. IF the listing was deleted THEN cancelled orders SHALL not restore stock

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the stock system to handle high-throughput scenarios reliably, so that race conditions don't cause overselling or data corruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple users purchase simultaneously THEN the system SHALL use database-level locking to prevent race conditions
2. WHEN stock reaches zero THEN subsequent purchase attempts SHALL be rejected atomically
3. WHEN processing concurrent orders THEN the system SHALL ensure stock decrements are atomic and consistent
4. IF a database deadlock occurs THEN the system SHALL retry the operation with exponential backoff
5. WHEN under high load THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency without overselling

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to track stock history and changes, so that I can audit inventory movements and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN stock changes occur THEN the system SHALL emit appropriate events through the existing event system
2. WHEN stock is consumed by purchases THEN the system SHALL emit shop order events with stock impact information
3. WHEN stock is manually adjusted THEN the system SHALL emit shop listing updated events with stock change details
4. WHEN stock is refilled THEN the system SHALL emit shop listing updated events indicating stock replenishment
5. IF stock reaches zero THEN the system SHALL emit events indicating out-of-stock status

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the stock system to integrate seamlessly with existing shop functionality, so that current features continue to work without disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing shop listings are migrated THEN they SHALL default to unlimited stock to maintain current behavior
2. WHEN the stock system is disabled THEN the shop SHALL function as it currently does
3. WHEN importing shop listings THEN the system SHALL support stock quantities in the import format
4. WHEN exporting shop listings THEN the system SHALL include stock information in the export
5. IF stock validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages without breaking existing workflows
