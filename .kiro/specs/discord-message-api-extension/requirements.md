# Discord Message API Extension Requirements

## Introduction

This feature extends the existing Discord API methods to provide enhanced message management capabilities. Currently, the Discord service allows sending messages to channels but does not return the message ID or provide capabilities to update or delete messages after they are sent. This extension will add these crucial features to enable more dynamic Discord integrations.

## User Stories

### As a Takaro developer

I want the sendMessage API to return the created message ID  
So that I can reference and manage messages programmatically after creation

### As a Takaro developer

I want to update previously sent Discord messages  
So that I can edit content or embeds without sending new messages

### As a Takaro developer

I want to delete Discord messages programmatically  
So that I can remove outdated or incorrect messages

### As a module developer

I want to track and manage Discord messages sent by my modules  
So that I can create interactive and dynamic Discord experiences

## Acceptance Criteria

### Message Creation

- The system SHALL return the Discord message ID when a message is successfully sent
- The system SHALL return the message ID for both text messages and embed messages
- The system SHALL return the message ID in a consistent format that can be used for subsequent operations
- WHEN a message send operation fails, THEN the system SHALL NOT return a message ID

### Message Updates

- The system SHALL provide an updateMessage endpoint that accepts a message ID
- The system SHALL accept either a string message or embed object for updates
- The system SHALL maintain the same validation rules for updates as for message creation
- WHEN updating a message, the system SHALL preserve the original message timestamp
- IF the message ID does not exist or is inaccessible, THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error
- The system SHALL require the same permissions for updating as for sending messages

### Message Deletion

- The system SHALL provide a deleteMessage endpoint that accepts a message ID
- The system SHALL permanently remove the message from the Discord channel
- IF the message ID does not exist or is already deleted, THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error
- The system SHALL require appropriate permissions to delete messages

### Error Handling

- The system SHALL return clear error messages when operations fail
- The system SHALL differentiate between permission errors, not found errors, and Discord API errors
- The system SHALL maintain consistency with existing error handling patterns in the codebase

### API Consistency

- The system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing sendMessage functionality
- The system SHALL follow the existing API patterns and conventions
- The system SHALL use the same authentication and authorization mechanisms
- The system SHALL integrate with existing metrics and monitoring systems
