# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the Discord integration capabilities of the Takaro application by adding comprehensive Discord API routes that provide users with greater control over Discord server management. The enhancement includes role management with automatic synchronization between Takaro and Discord roles, channel listing, role linking configuration, and improved message sending capabilities with embed support.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a server administrator, I want to list all Discord roles in my server, so that I can see what roles are available for management and assignment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes a GET request to the Discord roles endpoint THEN the system SHALL return a list of all Discord roles for the specified server
2. WHEN the Discord roles are retrieved THEN the system SHALL include role ID, name, color, permissions, position, and other relevant role properties
3. IF the Discord bot lacks permission to view roles THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message
4. WHEN the roles list is requested THEN the system SHALL validate that the user has appropriate permissions to view Discord roles

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a server administrator, I want to list all Discord channels in my server, so that I can see available channels for message sending and management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes a GET request to the Discord channels endpoint THEN the system SHALL return a list of all Discord channels for the specified server
2. WHEN the Discord channels are retrieved THEN the system SHALL include channel ID, name, type, position, permissions, and other relevant channel properties
3. IF the Discord bot lacks permission to view channels THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message
4. WHEN the channels list is requested THEN the system SHALL validate that the user has appropriate permissions to view Discord channels
5. WHEN channels are listed THEN the system SHALL categorize channels by type (text, voice, category, etc.)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a server administrator, I want to send rich embed messages to Discord channels, so that I can create more visually appealing and informative messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes a POST request to send a Discord message with embed data THEN the system SHALL create and send a Discord embed message
2. WHEN an embed message is sent THEN the system SHALL support standard Discord embed properties (title, description, color, fields, footer, thumbnail, image, author, timestamp)
3. WHEN a message is sent THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing plain text message functionality
4. IF the embed data is malformed or invalid THEN the system SHALL return appropriate validation errors
5. WHEN sending messages THEN the system SHALL validate that the target channel exists and the bot has permission to send messages
6. WHEN sending embed messages THEN the system SHALL validate that the requesting user has appropriate permissions
7. IF the Discord API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL handle this gracefully with appropriate error responses
