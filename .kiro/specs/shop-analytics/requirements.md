### Performance

- **REQ-012**: The system SHALL provide customer metrics (top buyers, unique customers, repeat purchase rate)
- **REQ-013**: The system SHALL provide category performance metrics

- **REQ-015**: IF stock management is enabled for items, THEN the system SHALL provide stock level warnings

### Date Filtering
- **REQ-016**: The system SHALL accept optional date range parameters (startDate, endDate)

### Frontend Display

- **REQ-024**: The system SHALL handle deleted shop listings gracefully in historical data
- **REQ-025**: The system SHALL exclude test or demo data if flagged

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Security
- **REQ-026**: The system SHALL NOT expose individual player purchase data without proper permissions
- **REQ-027**: The system SHALL validate all input parameters to prevent SQL injection

### Scalability

- **REQ-029**: The system SHALL use database indexes optimized for analytics queries

### Maintainability
- **REQ-030**: The system SHALL log cache hits/misses for monitoring
- **REQ-031**: The system SHALL provide metrics on analytics generation time

## Out of Scope

- Real-time analytics updates (data is cached for 1 hour)
- Cross-server analytics comparison
- Predictive analytics or forecasting
- Export functionality (may be added in future iteration)
- Custom date grouping beyond standard periods

## Dependencies

- Redis must be available for caching
- Existing ECharts components in the frontend
- Shop module must be enabled for the game server
- User must have appropriate permissions (MANAGE_SHOP or equivalent)

## Success Metrics

- Analytics page load time < 2 seconds with cached data
- Cache hit rate > 90% during normal usage
- User engagement with analytics features (tracked via telemetry)
- Reduction in support requests about shop performance
