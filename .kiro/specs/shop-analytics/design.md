# Design: Shop Analytics

## Layer 1: Problem & Requirements

### Problem Statement
Server administrators need visibility into their shop's performance across all their game servers to make data-driven decisions about pricing, inventory, and product offerings. Currently, they lack comprehensive analytics about sales trends, customer behavior, and revenue metrics, making it difficult to optimize their in-game economy at both server-specific and domain-wide levels.

### Current Situation (AS-IS)
The shop system currently provides:
- Basic listing management at `/gameserver/$gameServerId/shop`
- Order viewing and management at `/gameserver/$gameServerId/shop/orders`
- Category management for shop admins
- Simple table views showing current orders with status badges

However, administrators cannot:
- See revenue trends over time
- Compare performance across multiple game servers
- Identify best-selling items across their domain
- Understand customer purchasing patterns
- Monitor shop performance metrics at scale

### Stakeholders
- **Primary**: Server administrators who manage shop listings and pricing
- **Secondary**: Server owners who monitor overall economy health
- **Technical**: Platform team maintaining the shop module

### Goals
- Provide comprehensive shop analytics through a single, performant endpoint
- Enable data-driven decision making for shop administrators
- Minimize performance impact through intelligent caching
- Integrate seamlessly with existing shop interface

### Non-Goals
- Real-time analytics (1-hour cache is acceptable)
- Predictive analytics or ML-based forecasting
- Custom report generation or exports
- Per-player purchase history views

### Constraints
- Must use existing Redis infrastructure for caching
- Must leverage existing chart components from lib-components (BarChart, LineChart, AreaChart, PieChart)
- Analytics queries may be expensive (hence 1-hour cache requirement)
- Must respect existing permission system (shop admin only)

### Requirements

#### Functional Requirements
- REQ-001: The system SHALL display analytics in the main navigation only to users with MANAGE_SHOP_LISTINGS permission
- REQ-002: The system SHALL support filtering analytics by single or multiple game servers
- REQ-003: The system SHALL provide all analytics data through a single API endpoint
- REQ-004: The system SHALL cache analytics data in Redis for 1 hour
- REQ-009: The system SHALL provide total revenue metrics (daily, weekly, monthly, all-time)
- REQ-010: The system SHALL provide top-selling items by quantity and revenue
- REQ-011: The system SHALL provide order status distribution
- REQ-012: The system SHALL provide customer metrics
- REQ-016: The system SHALL accept optional date range and gameServerId filters

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- NFR-001: Performance - Cached responses within 200ms
- NFR-002: Security - Validate permissions before data access
- NFR-003: Scalability - Handle shops with up to 100,000 orders

## Layer 2: Functional Specification

### Overview
The shop analytics feature adds a new "Analytics" section to the main navigation sidebar, visible only to administrators with MANAGE_SHOP_LISTINGS permission. This section displays comprehensive metrics about shop performance across one or multiple game servers using interactive charts and statistics cards.

### User Workflows

1. **Accessing Analytics**
   - Admin sees "Analytics" option in main sidebar navigation
   - Clicks Analytics link
   - System checks permissions and loads analytics dashboard
   - Can filter by specific game servers or view domain-wide stats

2. **Viewing Metrics**
   - Dashboard displays multiple metric cards with charts
   - User can select time period (7d, 30d, 90d, 1y, all-time)
   - Charts update to show data for selected period
   - Hover interactions show detailed values

3. **Cache Behavior**
   - First request generates analytics (may take 2-5 seconds)
   - Subsequent requests within 1 hour return instantly
   - Cache key includes selected gameServerIds and date range

### External Interfaces

#### API Endpoint
```
GET /api/analytics/shop
Query params:
  - gameServerIds (array of UUIDs, optional - defaults to all)
  - startDate (ISO 8601, optional)
  - endDate (ISO 8601, optional)
Response: Comprehensive analytics object (cached)
```

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Multiple Endpoints Approach**
   - **Pros**: Granular caching, smaller payloads
   - **Cons**: Multiple requests, complex cache management
   - **Why not chosen**: Requirements specify single endpoint for simplicity

2. **Real-time Analytics**
   - **Pros**: Always current data
   - **Cons**: Performance impact, database load
   - **Why not chosen**: Heavy queries make caching necessary

3. **Separate Analytics Service**
   - **Pros**: Scalability, dedicated resources
   - **Cons**: Complexity, additional infrastructure
   - **Why not chosen**: Over-engineering for current needs

### Why This Solution
The chosen approach balances performance with simplicity by:
- Using a single cached endpoint (REQ-003, REQ-004)
- Leveraging existing UI patterns and components
- Minimal changes to existing architecture
- Clear permission boundaries (REQ-001)

        };
        gameServerIds: string[];
      };
    }
    ```
  - Auth: Requires MANAGE_SHOP_LISTINGS permission

### Implementation Details

#### Cache Strategy
```typescript
async getAnalytics(gameServerIds?: string[], startDate?: string, endDate?: string) {
  const serverKey = gameServerIds ? gameServerIds.sort().join(',') : 'all';
  const cacheKey = `shop:analytics:${this.domainId}:${serverKey}:${startDate || 'all'}:${endDate || 'now'}`;
  const redis = await Redis.getClient('shop-analytics');
  
  // Try cache first
  const cached = await redis.get(cacheKey);
  if (cached) {
    return JSON.parse(cached);
  }
  
  // Generate analytics
  const analytics = await this.generateAnalytics(gameServerIds, startDate, endDate);
  
  // Cache for 1 hour
  await redis.setEx(cacheKey, 3600, JSON.stringify(analytics));
  
  return analytics;
}
```

#### Key SQL Queries
```sql
-- Revenue over time
SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC('day', "createdAt") as date,
  SUM(amount * price) as revenue
FROM "shopOrder" o
JOIN "shopListing" l ON o."listingId" = l.id
WHERE o.status = 'COMPLETED'
  AND ($1::uuid[] IS NULL OR l."gameServerId" = ANY($1))
  AND o."createdAt" BETWEEN $2 AND $3
GROUP BY date
ORDER BY date;

-- Top selling items
SELECT 
  l.id,
  l.name,
  SUM(o.amount) as quantity,
  SUM(o.amount * l.price) as revenue
FROM "shopOrder" o
JOIN "shopListing" l ON o."listingId" = l.id
WHERE o.status = 'COMPLETED'
  AND ($1::uuid[] IS NULL OR l."gameServerId" = ANY($1))
GROUP BY l.id, l.name
ORDER BY quantity DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

#### Security Considerations
- Permission check via `AuthService.getAuthMiddleware([PERMISSIONS.MANAGE_SHOP_LISTINGS])`
- Input validation for date parameters
- SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries
- Cache keys include domain context

#### Error Handling
- Cache failures: Log and continue to generate fresh data
- Database timeouts: Return 503 with retry-after header
- Invalid date ranges: Return 400 with specific error message
- Permission denied: Return 403 (follows existing pattern)

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests
```javascript
describe('ShopAnalyticsService', () => {
  it('returns cached data when available', () => {});
  it('generates fresh data on cache miss', () => {});
  it('handles invalid date ranges', () => {});
  it('includes all required metrics', () => {});
  it('filters by multiple game servers', () => {});
  it('returns domain-wide stats when no filter', () => {});
})
```

#### Integration Tests
```javascript
describe('Shop Analytics API', () => {
  it('requires proper permissions', () => {});
  it('caches responses for 1 hour', () => {});
  it('handles large datasets efficiently', () => {});
  it('generates realistic analytics from purchase data', async () => {
    // Setup: Create multiple players and listings
    // Simulate purchases over time from different players
    // Verify analytics match expected values
  });
  it('correctly aggregates cross-server data', () => {});
})
```

The integration tests will follow patterns from `ShopOrder.integration.test.ts`, using the `shopSetup` helper to create test data and simulating realistic purchase scenarios with multiple players buying different items over time.

### Rollout Plan
1. Deploy backend changes (service, controller, caching)
2. Deploy frontend with analytics tab
3. Monitor cache hit rates and query performance
4. Adjust cache duration if needed

## Appendix

### Performance Considerations
- Database indexes already exist on key columns
- Aggregate queries use existing indexes efficiently
- Cache warming could be added if needed
- Consider materialized views for very large datasets
