Takaro is a web-based, multi-gameserver manager. It features a web interface to manage your gameservers, and a REST API to interact with them. For detailed information, visit our [documentation](https://docs.takaro.io).

## Modules

The core of Takaro is built around Modules. Modules offer a very powerful and flexible way of creating features.

Here are some examples:

- **AFK-kick module**: tracks player activity and automatically removes inactive players.

- **Teleport module**: offers set of in-game commands enabling players to create their own teleport points and teleport to them.

- **Economy module**: introduces a virtual currency, actively engaging players in earning and spending currency. Players can accumulate currency through diverse activities. E.g. defeating entities, earning daily login rewards and participating in bounty hunting. Additionally, players can transact currency among themselves or use it to purchase items from a customizable shop. 
- **Bounty module**: builds upon the Economy module, this feature allows players to set bounties on other players. When a player with a bounty is defeated, the bounty reward is transferred to the victor. 



### Custom modules
The above modules represent only a **tiny fraction** of the modules maintained by the Takaro team. 
To explore all the modules we offer, visit our [full List of Built-In Modules](https://docs.takaro.io/built-in-modules)

If however the current modules don't cater to your specific needs, don't worry. Takaro also provides a development environment to create your own custom modules.
