## What will happen to CSMM?

CSMM will continue to be maintained for the foreseeable future. Once Takaro is more mature and becomes widely used, CSMM will be deprecated and eventually discontinued. 
There is no time frame for this at the moment, we plan to 'go with the flow', if we notice more people are using Takaro than CSMM, we will start the deprecation process.
This will most likely coincide with the release of a new Alpha version of 7 days to die.
