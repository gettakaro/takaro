# Writing custom modules

While the Takaro Team is committed to providing a comprehensive set of built-in modules,
there may be instances where a particular feature you need is unavailable, or perhaps
there is no existing module for a feature you desire. 

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
   This is focused on advanced users familiar with Javascript. 
    If you need support, or if you believe your feature could enrich our suite of built-in modules,
    we encourage you to reach out to our <a href="https://aka.candaele.dev/discord" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a> community.

## Functions

Functions are a Takaro object, they are the actual code that is executed when a Hook, Cronjob or Command is triggered. Functions are written in JavaScript and can be created in the Takaro Web UI.

Inside a Function, you will have access to data about the event that triggered it, as well as the ability to interact with the game server. The Function will come pre-loaded with an API client (`lib-apiclient`).

For example, you can send a message to a player when they join a server, or you can teleport a player to a specific location.

### Writing functions

All functions will have the same basic skeleton, which looks like this:

```js
import { getTakaro, getData } from '@takaro/helpers';
async function main() {
  const data = await getData();
  const takaro = await getTakaro(data);

  // TODO: write my function...
}
main();
```

Let's dissect this line by line

`import { getTakaro, getData } from '@takaro/helpers';`

This line imports two helper functions from the @takaro/helpers module. These functions, `getTakaro`and `getData`, provide access to the necessary data and the Takaro instance within the function. The `takaro` object is a wrapper around the API, with this object you can read and write data from/to Takaro. `getData` will provide you with information about the triggered event, for example if you are writing a Command, this object will contain information about the player who executed the command.

```js
async function main() {}
main();
```

These lines of code define a function and immediately calls it. This is necessary because the Takaro Function runtime expects a function to be exported from the file. The function is called `main` but you can name it whatever you want.

```js
const data = await getData();
const takaro = await getTakaro(data);

// TODO: write my function...
```

These lines of code call the helper functions we imported earlier. `getData` will return an object containing information about the event that triggered the function. `getTakaro` will return a Takaro instance, which you can use to interact with the API.
