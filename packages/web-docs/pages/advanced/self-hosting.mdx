# Self hosting

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  Takaro is designed to be a cloud-first, highly available, and scalable platform. We recommend using our hosted
  solution to ensure the best experience for you and your players. This self hosting guide is provided as a reference
  for advanced users who wish to run Takaro on their own infrastructure.
</Callout>

This guide will set up a basic Takaro instance on a single server. This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of
Docker and general server administration. We make a lot of assumptions about the
environment in which Takaro is running, you will need to adapt this guide to your specific environment.

For simplicity, we will not cover certain aspects of running a production service in this guide, such as backups, monitoring, security hardening, scaling, etc.

## Prerequisites

- A server running Ubuntu 24.04
  - Other Linux distributions may work, but this guide is written for and tested on Ubuntu 24.04
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- A domain name pointing to your server
  - You will need 2 A records, one to the top level domain (takaro.example.com) and one to the wildcard domain (\*.takaro.example.com)
- Basic unix command line utilities like git, vim, and curl will be useful

## Installation

Clone the Takaro repository to your server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gettakaro/takaro.git
```

There is a reference Docker compose file at `deploy/compose/docker-compose.yaml`.
Take a look at this file to see what we'll be deploying.

```bash
cd deploy/compose
cat docker-compose.yaml
```

Let's replace the placeholder domain with your domain, we'll be using `sed` to do this:

```bash
sed -i 's/takaro.example.com/takaro.your-domain.com/g' docker-compose.yaml
```

The containers use a network called `takaro`, we need to create this network:

```bash
docker network create takaro
```

The compose file will store a bunch of persistent data. Different containers need different permissions on these folders

```bash
./scripts/setup-data-folders.sh
```

The compose file is set up to provision TLS certificates via Cloudflare. You will need to add an env var `CF_DNS_API_TOKEN` with your Cloudflare API token. You can get this token from the Cloudflare dashboard.
There are other providers supported, see the [Traefik docs](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/https/acme/#providers) for more info.

Copy the example .env file from the repo and edit it as needed

```bash
cp ../../.env.example .env
```

Now we can start the services with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

You will need to create an admin client in Hydra.

```bash
docker compose exec hydra hydra -e http://localhost:4445  create client --grant-type client_credentials --audience t:api:admin --format json
```

Copy the client id and secret and set the ADMIN_CLIENT_ID and ADMIN_CLIENT_SECRET in your .env file.
Give the containers a restart after you've done this.

Finally, you should be able to access the Takaro web interface at `https://takaro.your-domain.com`.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, you should always check the logs of the services you are running. You can do this with the following command:

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

If you know the error is with a specific service, you can filter the logs to only show that service:

```bash
docker compose logs -f <service-name>
```
