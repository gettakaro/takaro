# Functions

Functions are a Takaro object, they are the actual code that is executed when a Hook, Cronjob or Command is triggered. Functions are written in JavaScript and can be created in the Takaro Web UI.

Inside a Function, you will have access to data about the event that triggered it, as well as the ability to interact with the Gameserver. The Function will come pre-loaded with an API client (`lib-apiclient`).

For example, you can send a message to a player when they join a server, or you can teleport a player to a specific location.

## Writing functions

All functions will have the same basic skeleton, which looks like this:

```js
import { getTakaro, getData } from '@takaro/helpers';
async function main() {
    const data = await getData();
    const takaro = await getTakaro(data);

    // TODO: write my function...
}
main();
```

Let's dissect this line by line

`import { getTakaro, getData } from '@takaro/helpers';`

This line imports two helper functions from the @takaro/helpers module. These functions, `getTakaro`and `getData`, provide access to the necessary data and the Takaro instance within the function. The `takaro` object is a wrapper around the API, with this object you can read and write data from/to Takaro. `getData` will provide you with information about the triggered event, for example if you are writing a Command, this object will contain information about the player who executed the command.

```js
async function main() {
}
main();
```

These lines of code define a function and immediately calls it. This is necessary because the Takaro Function runtime expects a function to be exported from the file. The function is called `main` but you can name it whatever you want.

```js
    const data = await getData();
    const takaro = await getTakaro(data);

    // TODO: write my function...
```

These lines of code call the helper functions we imported earlier. `getData` will return an object containing information about the event that triggered the function. `getTakaro` will return a Takaro instance, which you can use to interact with the API.
