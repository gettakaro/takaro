## Resetting data

There are two ways to reset database data, each applicable in different situations. If your environment is running correctly, you can quickly delete all domains (with related data) using the `dev-remove-domains.mjs` script. This script will talk to the Takaro API, thus if your application is not running this will fail. This script is significantly faster than the other option.

```bash
docker-compose exec takaro node scripts/dev-remove-domains.mjs
```

If your setup is well and truly messed up, you can use the `dev-reset-data.sh` script. This will take down the containers, remove the database data on file system level and then restart the containers.

```bash
./scripts/dev-reset-data.sh
```

## "Starting from scratch"

Cleaning out all artifacts from the repo and rebuilding everything. This will take a while, so go grab some ☕️.

```bash
npm run clean && ./scripts/dev-init.sh && docker-compose up -d --build
```
