# Getting started

This document will guide you through installing Takaro locally for development. If you are a user of Takaro, you can skip this document and go straight to the [User Guide](/).

The Takaro development environment targets Unix devices (with a focus on Linux)! If you are on Windows, you can use [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).

## Development setup

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  If you plan to make code changes, it's a good idea to first create a copy of the repo in your own Github account:
  [Fork the repo](https://github.com/gettakaro/takaro/fork)
</Callout>

This is an opinionated development setup. It will get you up and running quickly.
It comes with a few services/tools/scripts that are useful for developing, testing and debugging.

Think of this as "Takaro in a box". It is not meant to be used as a production environment, but it will get you up and running quickly.

```bash
# Clone the repo
cd /to/where/you/want/to/clone/takaro
git clone git@github.com:gettakaro/takaro.git
cd takaro

# Run the init script from the root of the repo. This will install all development dependencies, it can take a while...
./scripts/dev-init.sh

# While this is running, take a look at the generated .env file and adjust as needed
```

Start the development environment:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

You will need to create an admin client for the following configuration scripts. Set the `ADMIN_CLIENT_ID` and `ADMIN_CLIENT_SECRET` in your .env file. Give the containers a restart after you've done this.

```bash
docker compose exec hydra hydra -e http://localhost:4445  create client --grant-type client_credentials --audience t:api:admin --format json
```

At this point, everything should be running. There is a dashboard available where all the services are listed. You can access it at http://localhost:13337.

To view logs:

```sh
docker-compose logs -f

# Since Takaro has lots of services, you might want to filter the logs:
# For example, to only see only Takaro logs
docker-compose logs -f takaro
```

Optionally (but recommended!), you can set up some testing data automatically.

```bash
# Generate data for the standard development setup
docker compose exec takaro node scripts/dev-data.mjs
```
