## Roles and permissions

In Takaro, roles are flexible and customizable according to the needs of the users. To start with, Takaro provides a set of default roles like 'Admin' and 'Moderator' These roles serve as a foundation upon which users can build and customize their roles.

The roles consist of multiple Permissions. Permissions in Takaro can be built-in, like "Manage modules" or "Read players", or dynamic Module permissions. MOdule permissions allow for a high degree of customization. They can be created based on installed/configured Modules. For example, a Module permission could be created to allow only moderators to set public teleports, or to allow only VIP users to be rewarded for zombie kills.

Roles can be assigned to Users and/or Players. User roles define what actions users can take on the API/dashboard of Takaro. Player roles control what actions can be taken in-game.

Players can be assigned Roles on a global level or they can be set for a specific gameserver. For example, a Player can be assigned a role on Gameserver A with the "Set public teleports" permission. This will allow the Player to set public teleports on Gameserver A, but not on Gameserver B.
