# Rust

Takaro connects to your server using the RCON protocol over websocket

## Setting Up RCON Credentials

Before Takaro can connect to your Rust server, you will need to configure RCON (Remote Console) credentials. These credentials allow Takaro to authenticate and interact with your Rust server through the RCON protocol.

- Locate your server configuration file (server.cfg).
- Ensure that the RCON protocol is enabled by setting rcon.web to 1.
- Set the rcon.password to a strong password that will be used by Takaro to authenticate.
- Set the rcon.port to define on which port the RCON should listen.

```sh
rcon.web 1
rcon.password "yourStrongPassword"
rcon.port 28016
```

  Note: The RCON password is sensitive, and you should treat it as a password.
  It is advised to use a combination of numbers, letters, lowercase, uppercase,
  as well as symbols.

## How Takaro Connects to Your Rust Server

Takaro connects to the Rust server using the RCON protocol using web protocols, which allows it to listen for events happening on the server and send commands and receive responses from the server.
