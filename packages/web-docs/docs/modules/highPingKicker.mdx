## Key Features

- Automatic ping monitoring
- Configurable ping thresholds
- Warning system before kicks
- Customizable number of warnings
- Player immunity options through permissions

## Configuration Options

### 1. Ping Threshold

- Default value: 200ms
- Purpose: Defines the maximum acceptable ping value
- When a player's ping exceeds this threshold, they begin receiving warnings
- Can be adjusted based on your server's requirements and geographical location

### 2. Warnings Before Kick

- Default value: 3 warnings
- Purpose: Determines how many warnings a player receives before being kicked
- Provides players with opportunities to resolve connection issues
- Each warning is tracked individually per player

## How It Works

The module operates on a 5-minute cycle (configured via cron job: `*/5 * * * *`) and performs the following steps:

1. **Monitoring**: Checks all online players' ping values
2. **Warning System**:
    - If a player's ping exceeds the threshold, they receive a warning
    - Warnings are tracked using Takaro's variable system
    - Each subsequent high ping check increments the warning count
3. **Kick Action**:
    - When warnings reach the configured limit, the player is kicked
    - Kick message includes their ping value for reference
    - Warning count is reset after a kick

Example warning message:
`Server is shutting down in 5 minutes for daily maintenance. We'll be back online in ~10 minutes. Please find a safe spot!`

## Implementation Details

The module uses Takaro's variable system to track warnings with the key `highPingKicker:warnings`. This ensures persistence across server restarts and allows for accurate warning tracking.

### Warning Process:

1. First high ping detection: Creates warning variable
2. Subsequent detections: Increments warning count
3. Final warning: Executes kick and resets counter

### Permissions

The module includes one permission:

- `GEOBLOCK_IMMUNITY`: Players with this permission will not be kicked regardless of their ping
    - Useful for administrators or trusted players
    - Can be assigned through Takaro's role system

### Installation

1. Navigate to your server's Modules section
2. Select "Install New Module"
3. Find and select "highPingKicker"
4. Configure the desired ping threshold and warning count
5. Save and activate the module

## Best Practices

1. **Initial Setup**:
    - Start with default values (200ms ping threshold, 3 warnings)
    - Monitor player feedback and server logs
    - Adjust values based on your community's needs
2. **Threshold Configuration**:
    - Consider your server's geographical location
    - Account for typical ping ranges in your target regions
    - Set thresholds that balance performance with accessibility
3. **Warning Management**:
    - Use enough warnings to allow for temporary connection issues
    - Keep warning count reasonable to maintain server performance
    - Consider time between checks (default 5 minutes)

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Too Many Kicks**:
    - Increase ping threshold
    - Add more warnings before kick
    - Review server performance metrics
2. **Ineffective Management**:
    - Decrease ping threshold
    - Reduce warning count
    - Decrease check interval
3. **False Positives**:
    - Grant immunity to affected players
    - Adjust threshold based on time of day
