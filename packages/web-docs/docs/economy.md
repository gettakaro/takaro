# Economy

Takaro allows users to enable an economy system on their server. This is a virtual currency system that allows users to earn and spend money on the server. This is a great way to encourage users to be active on the server and reward them for their activity.

Players can earn money in many ways using some of the [built-in modules](./built-in-modules.mdx) or you can create your own custom modules to allow players to earn money in other ways.

Currency is kept per gameserver, so if you have multiple gameservers, each gameserver will have its own currency. This makes it easier to balance the economy on each gameserver; you might want different prices on your PvP server than on your PvE server for example.
