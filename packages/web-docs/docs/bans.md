# Bans

Takaro gives you the ability to manage banned players on your servers. This is useful for keeping your server safe and free from toxic players. Using the Takaro dashboard, you can view and query all bans on your server as well as ban and unban players.

If you ban someone from the Takaro dashboard, this ban is considered to be "Takaro managed". This means that the ban will be synced to your game server and the player will be banned in-game. If for whatever reason the ban is removed from the game server, Takaro will reapply the ban the next time it syncs. This is useful if you reset your server and forget to move over your ban data. To remove a Takaro managed ban, you must unban the player from the Takaro dashboard.

You can also mark a ban as "global". A global ban is a ban that applies to all your servers automatically. Global bans are always Takaro managed. If you add a new server to Takaro, the global bans will also be applied to the new server automatically.

:::warning
Takaro periodically syncs bans from your servers into the database. This means that if you ban someone on your gameserver directly instead of via the Takaro dashboard, it might take a little while for the ban to show up in the dashboard.
