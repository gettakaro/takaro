# Spacing
Cosistent spacing of width, height, margins and padding maintain visual balance in the design system.

## Spacing tokens
The design system provides spacers that can be used vertically and horizontally. The smaller spacers should be used on more detailed spacing of elements within reusable components.
The larger spacers should be used on layout spacing. **These spacing tokens should be used for all possible spacings!**
