## Surface and Elevation

Elevation styles are used to create separation between surfaces. 6 elevation styles are avilable in a range of depths.
In default mode, elevation is created through shadows and elevation design tokens. In dark mode, on surfaces with elevation (i.e. Cards),
an additional transparent overlay is used to lighten the surface color and creat the visual effect of an elevated surface.
