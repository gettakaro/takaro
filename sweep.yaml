description: "Test coverage is very important to us. Always check for related tests. If you are working with backend code, the tests will usually be in a subfolder called __tests__. If you are making frontend changes, look for tests in packages/e2e, the frontend tests use playwright. We care about test coverage, so if you add a separate execution path, add a new test rather than replacing the logic."
